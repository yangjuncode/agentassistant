# Broadcast Methods Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the `broadcastAskQuestionReply` and `broadcastWorkReportReply` methods in the WebSocket handler.

## Overview

These methods enable real-time notification of all connected web clients (except the sender) when a client responds to an AskQuestion or WorkReport request. This allows for collaborative awareness in multi-user scenarios.

## Implementation Details

### 1. BroadcastToAllExcept Method

Added to `broadcaster.go`:

```go
func (b *Broadcaster) BroadcastToAllExcept(message *agentassistproto.WebsocketMessage, excludeClientID string)
```

This method:
- Iterates through all connected clients
- Sends the message to active clients except the specified `excludeClientID`
- Handles failed sends by unregistering unresponsive clients
- Logs the number of clients that received the message

### 2. broadcastAskQuestionReply Method

Added to `websocket.go`:

```go
func (h *WebSocketHandler) broadcastAskQuestionReply(client *WebClient, message *agentassistproto.WebsocketMessage)
```

This method:
- Validates that the message contains AskQuestionRequest data
- Creates a notification message with command "AskQuestionReplyNotification"
- Includes the original request data and response data
- Adds a descriptive message indicating which client provided the response
- Broadcasts to all clients except the sender

### 3. broadcastWorkReportReply Method

Added to `websocket.go`:

```go
func (h *WebSocketHandler) broadcastWorkReportReply(client *WebClient, message *agentassistproto.WebsocketMessage)
```

This method:
- Validates that the message contains WorkReportRequest data
- Creates a notification message with command "WorkReportReplyNotification"
- Includes the original request data and response data
- Adds a descriptive message indicating which client confirmed task completion
- Broadcasts to all clients except the sender

## Message Flow

1. **Client A** sends an AskQuestionReply or WorkReportReply
2. **WebSocket Handler** processes the reply:
   - Calls `handleAskQuestionReply` or `handleWorkReportReply` to process the response
   - Calls `broadcastAskQuestionReply` or `broadcastWorkReportReply` to notify other clients
3. **Broadcaster** sends notification to all other connected clients
4. **Other clients** receive the notification and can update their UI accordingly

## Notification Message Structure

### AskQuestionReplyNotification

```json
{
  "cmd": "AskQuestionReplyNotification",
  "askQuestionRequest": {
    "id": "original-request-id",
    "userToken": "user-token",
    "request": { /* original request data */ }
  },
  "askQuestionResponse": { /* response data */ },
  "strParam": "Response received from client {clientID}"
}
```

### WorkReportReplyNotification

```json
{
  "cmd": "WorkReportReplyNotification",
  "workReportRequest": {
    "id": "original-request-id",
    "userToken": "user-token", 
    "request": { /* original request data */ }
  },
  "workReportResponse": { /* response data */ },
  "strParam": "Task completion confirmed by client {clientID}"
}
```

## Usage in WebSocket Handler

The broadcast methods are automatically called when processing replies:

```go
case "AskQuestionReply":
    h.handleAskQuestionReply(client, &message)
    h.broadcastAskQuestionReply(client, &message)
case "WorkReportReply":
    h.handleWorkReportReply(client, &message)
    h.broadcastWorkReportReply(client, &message)
```

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Collaboration**: All connected clients are immediately notified when someone responds
2. **Awareness**: Users can see when others have answered questions or completed tasks
3. **Coordination**: Prevents duplicate work by showing when tasks are already handled
4. **Transparency**: Provides visibility into team activity and progress

## Error Handling

- Methods validate input data before broadcasting
- Failed message sends automatically trigger client cleanup
- Logging provides visibility into broadcast success/failure
- Graceful handling of missing or invalid data

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests in `broadcast_test.go` that verify:
- Messages are sent to all clients except the sender
- Correct message structure and content
- Proper client filtering and exclusion
- Error handling for invalid data
