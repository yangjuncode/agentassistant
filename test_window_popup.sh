echo "- The window should become visible and focused even if it was minimized or hidden"
echo "- On Linux X11, the window should stay on top for 5 seconds to ensure visibility"
echo "- The window should remain focused and not fall back to background immediately"
echo "- This should work reliably on Linux desktop environments"
